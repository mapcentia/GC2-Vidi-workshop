# Database administration
In the Database tab, the database can be manage. This is where the overall characteristics of the layers can be set and the table structure can be changed.

## Layer grid
![Layer grid](http://mapcentia.screenstepslive.com/s/en/m/35406/l/346782/show_image?image_id=1400523)   

Layer properties can be changed by double-clicking on the grid cell you want to change.

1. Type: Layer geometry type, which can be (MULTI)POINT, (MULTI)LINESTRING (MULTI)POLYGON or GEOMETRY. The latter means that the layer may have a mixture of several different types. The layer type can not be changed.
2. Name: The technical name of the layer. If the layer is imported from a file, the name match the file name.
3. Title: A title for the layer. If a title is applied, this will appear in layer trees, legends, WMS / WFS titles etc.
4. Description: A descriptive text for the layer. Applied to WMS / WFS abstracts.
5. Group: Groups are used to divide layer trees in the Map tab and in the Viewer. This combo box: Either enter the name of a new group or select an already existing one.
6. Sort id: Location of the layer in layer hierarchy. Sets whether a layer is on top of or underneath another layer when they appear together in the Map tab or Viewer.
7. Authentication: What level of authentication is required for the individual layers in WMS and WFS services? Write = authentication only when writing, Read/Write = authentication when reading and writing, None = no authentication on the layer.
8. Editable: If turned off, the layer can not be edited in the Map tab or through WFS-T.
9. Tile cache: Manually bust the layer's tile cache. This is usually not necessary to do since GC2 do it automatically when needed.
